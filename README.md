# <Prework-study-guide>

## Description

This project is a prework study guide for my upcoming coding bootcamp at DU. It was made as a tool to help me study HTML, Git, JavaScript, and CSS.
I thought it would a good way to both study and get practice coding at the same time. 
This website solves the problem of studying seperate from practicing, while using it, i was able to study, and practice what i was studying simultaniously.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
